    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Credit risk is most simply defined as the potential that a bank borrower or counterparty will fail to meet its obligations in accordance with agreed terms. The goal of credit risk management is to maximise a bank's risk-adjusted rate of return by maintaining credit risk exposure within acceptable parameters. Banks need to manage the credit risk inherent in the entire portfolio as well as the risk in individual credits or transactions. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The following dataset has 150.000 records of borrowers taken from an anonymous bank, which are described through 12 different columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this test is to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on this dataset, to understand the information contained and obtain insights that could be relevant to solve a business problem and develop a simple model that could predict the risk.\n",

    "Below is a description of the involved columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Variable Name | Description | \n",
    "| ------------- | ----------- |\n",
    "| unnamed:0 | ID of borrower |\n",
    "| serious_dlqin2yrs | Person experienced 90 days past due delinquency or worse |\n",
    "| revolving_utilization_of_unsecured_lines | Total balance on credit cards and personal lines of credit except real estate and no installment debt like car loans divided by the sum of credit limits |\n",
    "| age | Age of borrower in years | \n",
    "| number_of_time30-59_days_past_due_not_worse | Number of times borrower has been 30-59 days past due but no worse in the last 2 years |\n",
    "| debt_ratio | Monthly debt payments, alimony, living costs divided by monthy gross income |\n",
    "| monthly_income | Monthly income |\n",
    "| number_of_open_credit_lines_and_loans | Number of open loans (installment like car loan or mortgage) and lines of credit (e.g. credit cards) |\n",
    "| number_of_times90_days_late | Number of times borrower has been 90 days or more past due |\n",
    "| number_real_estate_loans_or_lines | Number of mortgage and real estate loans including home equity lines of credit |\n",
    "| number_of_time60-89_days_past_due_not_worse | Number of times borrower has been 60-89 days past due but no worse in the last 2 years |\n",

    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook you have to load all the libraries you need to explore and process the given dataset, and then perform the analysis to extract meaningful facts in order to understand the information involved. You are free to make any kind of analytic you want, but at the end it is expected to have done the \"mandatory\" tasks on this work. In addition, there are some \"nice to have\" aspects that would enrich the work done.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Please provide reports in English and focus on findings and insights\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stack of technologies:** The analysis on this notebook should be done by using at least the following stack:   \n",
    "    - Python 3.x (not 2.x)\n",
    "    - Pandas 1.0.x\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Report insights and conclusions:** Describe the results obtained during the exploratory analysis and provide conclusions from a business perspective, supported by charts / tables / metrics. \n",
    "- **Data Quality Check:** You must check the quality of the given dataset to make an assessment of how appropriate it is for later Data Science tasks. Propose a set of corrective actions over the data.     \n",
    "   \n",
    "- **Feature extraction:** Indicate some possible candidates of features that could properly describe the borrowers, either from the given columns or from their transformations.\n",
    "- **Machine Learning modeling:** at least one fitted model with the given data. You could use the `serious_dlqin2yrs` column as target.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nice to have aspects\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dockerfile to setup environment.\n",
    "- Identify features and new attributes / tables that could be relevant or needed for better analysis\n",
    "- **Code versioning with Git** (you are free to publish it on your own Github/Bitbucket account!).\n",
    "- **Show proficiency in Python:** By showing good practices in the structure and documentation, usage of several programming paradigms (e.g. imperative, OOP, functional), etc.\n",
    "- **Use cases:** Describe possible use cases for this dataset that could add value to the given business, indicating methods / techniques and algorithms for each of them and justifying the choice made.\n",
    "- **Machine Learning approaches:** Describe the possible Machine Learning tasks that could be performed from the given data, which may be valuable in the context of the finance domain (just explain with words, don't fit a model).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you complete the assessment, please send a ZIP file of the folder with all the resources used in this work (e.g. Jupyter notebook, Python scripts, text files, images, etc) to esteban.delboca@fligoo.com. Then you are going to have a final meeting with the team to discuss the work done in this notebook and answer the questions that could arise.\n",
